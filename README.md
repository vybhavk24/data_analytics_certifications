# Data Analytics Certifications

**Aspiring Data Scientist | Frontend Developer | E&C Graduate**  
This repository documents my structured journey as I transition from frontend development to the world of **Data Analytics and Data Science**.

## 🌱 Purpose

This repository is dedicated to the certifications I am pursuing from platforms like **Coursera**, **Udemy**, and **Kaggle**, including:

- [IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst)
- [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)

## 🧠 Learning Approach

Each course is broken down into modules. For every module, you will find:

- 📒 **Notes**: Exported from Notion as `.md` files.
- 🧪 **Practicals**: Hands-on exercises, problems, and implementations in Python, SQL, Excel, or Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The following structure is maintained across all certification folders (IBM, Google, Udemy, etc.):

```
