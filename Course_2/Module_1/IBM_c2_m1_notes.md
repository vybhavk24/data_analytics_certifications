## Introduction to spreadsheets

### **What Is a Spreadsheet?**

A spreadsheet is a digital tool used to organize, store, and analyze data in a table format. Think of it as a giant, interactive table where each intersection of a row and column is called a **cell**. In these cells, you can input numbers, text, or formulas to perform calculations automatically.

- **Rows and Columns:**
    - **Rows** run horizontally and are typically numbered.
    - **Columns** run vertically and are usually labeled with letters (A, B, C, etc.).

Each cell is identified by its column letter and row number (for example, A1, B2).

- **Workbooks and Worksheets:**
    - A **workbook** is the entire Excel file.
    - A **worksheet** is an individual tab within a workbook. You can think of it as one “page” of data.

This structure is the starting point for almost everything you'll do in Excel.

### **Why Are Spreadsheets Important?**

Spreadsheets are vital in the real world for several reasons:

1. **Data Organization:**
    
    They allow you to label, sort, and structure data in a neat and accessible way.
    
2. **Data Analysis:**
    
    With built-in functions and formulas, spreadsheets let you perform calculations (like sums, averages, and more advanced statistical functions) automatically. This is essential for analyzing data trends, tracking progress, or summarizing information in reports.
    
3. **Decision Making:**
    
    Whether you're tracking expenses, evaluating business metrics, or managing a project, spreadsheets help you quickly see insights that support informed decisions.
    

For a data analyst, these abilities are crucial—they transform raw data into actionable knowledge.

### **Hands-On Learning on my MacBook Air**

Since I’m practicing on a MacBook Air, here’s a practical exercise:

1. **Opening Excel and Creating a New Workbook:**
    - Open **Excel** on Mac.
    - Select **New Workbook** to start with a fresh sheet.
2. **Creating Your First Table:**
    - **Step 1:** In cell A1, type `Name`.
    - **Step 2:** In cell B1, type `Age`.
    - **Step 3:** In cell C1, type `Score`.
    - **Step 4:** In cells A2 to A4, enter names like `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`.
    - **Step 5:** In cells B2 to B4, enter ages like `25`, `30`, `22`.
    - **Step 6:** In cells C2 to C4, enter scores like `85`, `92`, `78`.
    
    Here’s how it might look:
    
    | Name | Age | Score |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Alice | 25 | 85 |
    | Bob | 30 | 92 |
    | Charlie | 22 | 78 |
3. ***Using a Formula:***
    - In cell C5, try calculating the **sum** of all the scores. Click on cell C5 and type:`=SUM(C2:C4)`
    Then press **Enter**. Excel will compute the total score.
    - Notice how Excel automatically updates the result if you change any of the scores!
4. **Formatting:**
    - Select the header row (A1:C1) and use the formatting options (found in the toolbar) to bold the text. This makes it easier to distinguish headers from data.

These steps are designed to help you get comfortable with the basics. Each element—from naming your cells to applying a formula—builds your understanding of how data is structured and manipulated in a spreadsheet.

## **Spreadsheets Basics – Part 2**.

### 1. Formulas: The Backbone of Your Spreadsheet

**What Is a Formula?**

A formula is an equation you type into a cell that tells Excel to perform a calculation. Every formula starts with the equal sign (`=`). For example, if you type:

```
=A1+B1

```

Excel will add together the values in cells A1 and B1.

**Operators You Need to Know:**

- **Addition (`+`)**
- **Subtraction ()**
- **Multiplication ()**
- **Division (`/`)**
- **Parentheses (`()`)** to control the order of operations

**Real-World Connection:**

Imagine you're tracking your monthly expenses. Instead of manually adding up each expense every time, a formula can automatically compute your total spending, making your analysis both efficient and error-free.

### 2. Relative vs. Absolute References (practise)

When you copy a formula in Excel, you might want Excel to adjust the cell references automatically. That's where relative and absolute references come into play.

**Relative References:**

- When you type a formula like `=A1+B1` in cell C1 and copy it down to C2, Excel adjusts it to `=A2+B2`.
- **Use Case:** Best for calculations that should change as you move through rows or columns (e.g., summing each row independently).

**Absolute References:**

- Denoted by a dollar sign (`$`), an absolute reference keeps the cell reference fixed. For example, if you write `=$A$1+B1` in one cell and copy it, the reference to A1 will not change.
- **Example Exercise: Calculating Commission**
    - Suppose in cell B1 you set a fixed commission rate of 5% (enter 0.05).
    - In column A, you list different sales amounts.
    - In cell C2, type the formula:
    Here, A2 is relative (it will change as you move down) and $B$1 is absolute, so the commission rate remains constant across your dataset.
        
        ```
        =A2*$B$1
        
        ```
        
    - Drag the fill handle (the small square at the lower-right corner of the cell) down to apply the formula to other rows.

**Mixed References:**

- Sometimes you may want to lock only the row or the column. For example, `$A1` locks the column, while `A$1` locks the row.

### 3. Introduction to Functions

Functions are pre-built formulas in Excel that perform specific tasks.

**Common Functions and Their Uses:**

- **SUM:** Adds all the numbers in a given range.
    - *Example:*
        
        ```
        =SUM(C2:C4)
        ```
        
- **AVERAGE:** Computes the mean of numbers in a range.
    - *Example:*
        
        ```
        =AVERAGE(C2:C4)
        ```
        
- **COUNT:** Counts the number of cells that contain numbers within a range.
    - *Example:*
        
        ```
        =COUNT(C2:C4)
        ```
        
- **MIN and MAX:** Identify the smallest and largest numbers in a range, respectively.

**Why Use Functions?**

Using functions reduces errors, saves time, and makes your spreadsheet more scalable. Instead of recalculating numbers manually every time the data changes, functions automatically update the results.

### 4. The Fill Handle: Efficiently Spreading Formulas

**Using the Fill Handle:**

- Every time you create a formula, you don't have to type it into every cell.
- Locate the small square (fill handle) at the bottom-right corner of a selected cell.
- Click, hold, and drag the fill handle over the cells where you want the formula copied. Excel automatically adjusts the formula (unless an absolute reference is used).

**Practical Application:**

1. Enter your formula in one cell (for instance, `=A2*$B$1` from our commission example).
2. Drag the fill handle downwards along the column where you have your sales figures.
3. Watch as Excel dynamically computes the commission for each corresponding sale.

## **Using spreadsheets as a data analysis tool**

### 1. Organizing and Cleaning Data

**Key Idea:**

Every good analysis starts with well-organized data. When data arrives in scattered or messy forms, spreadsheets help you arrange it into rows and columns, making it digestible and ready for exploration.

**What You Can Do:**

- **Label Columns Clearly:**
Create headers for your data (e.g., Date, Sales, Customer Name).
- **Remove Duplicates & Inconsistencies:**
Use Excel’s built-in tools to filter out duplicates or quickly spot and correct errors.
- **Sort and Filter:**
Easily sort data (alphabetically or numerically) and apply filters to view specific subsets.
- **Conditional Formatting:**
Apply color scales or rules to highlight trends or outliers (e.g., flagging sales above a specific threshold).

**Real-World Application:**

Imagine a retail store tracking daily sales. By cleaning and organizing data, you can identify busy days, track seasonal trends, and spot discrepancies—all of which are crucial for strategic decisions.

### 2. Performing Calculations & Aggregations

**Key Idea:**

Spreadsheets allow you to make quick calculations with formulas and functions, turning raw numbers into actionable insights.

**What You Can Do:**

- **Basic Calculations:**
Use formulas for operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. For example, summing up daily sales with `=SUM(B2:B31)` for a month’s total.
- **Statistical Analysis:**
Functions like `AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and even `STDEV` let you assess performance or variability.
- **Relative and Absolute References:**
Understand how to use these to ensure formulas adapt correctly when copied to other cells. For instance, calculating commission on sales using an absolute reference for the commission rate.

**Real-World Application:**

A marketing analyst might calculate the average click-through rate (CTR) from multiple campaigns or identify the highest-performing days to fine-tune future strategies.

### 3. Data Visualization

**Key Idea:**

Visual representations make data immediately understandable and persuasive. Spreadsheets are equipped with a variety of charting tools to turn numbers into pictures.

**What You Can Do:**

- **Insert Charts and Graphs:**
Create bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots directly from your data.
- **Customize Visuals:**
Adjust chart types, add trendlines, set up legends, and customize color schemes to better convey your data’s story.
- **Dynamic Updates:**
When the underlying data changes, your charts update automatically, keeping your visuals relevant.

**Real-World Application:**

A sales manager can use graphs to present monthly performance trends at a team meeting, making it easier to spot successes and areas needing improvement.

### 4. Advanced Analysis with Pivot Tables

**Key Idea:**

Pivot tables summarize large amounts of data efficiently. They allow you to reorganize and aggregate information, shedding light on trends and comparisons that might be hidden in a long list of numbers.

**What You Can Do:**

- **Summarize Data:**
Quickly aggregate data by various dimensions (e.g., total sales by region or product category).
- **Drill Down:**
Click on summarized numbers to reveal the raw data behind them.
- **Cross-Tabulation:**
Compare different categories side by side to see relationships, such as customer demographics across different regions.

**Real-World Application:**

A financial analyst might use pivot tables to create a summary of expenses by department, helping management identify areas for cost reduction.

### 5. Hands-On Exercise on to practise on MacBook Air

Try this practical exercise to see these concepts in action:

1. **Organize Data:**
    
    Create a new Excel workbook.
    
    - In Row 1, input headers: `Date`, `Sales`, `Region`, and `Product Category`.
    - Fill in a few rows of data (you might use fictional data), such as:
        
        
        | Date | Sales | Region | Product Category |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | 2025-05-01 | 1500 | North | Electronics |
        | 2025-05-02 | 1250 | South | Apparel |
        | 2025-05-03 | 1750 | North | Electronics |
2. **Sort and Filter:**
    - Apply a filter by selecting your header row and using Excel’s Filter tool
    - Filter the data by `Region` to only show "North" entries.
        - Go to the row → Right click - filter → Filter by value → Now click on drop-down → Select the region you want to filter (Clear the filter afterwards).
        - In the Ribbon (toolbar at the top) → Go to data → Click on filter to remove it (You can use the same to apply also)
3. **Calculate Totals:**
    - In a new cell below your Sales column, type `=SUM(B2:B4)` to compute total sales.
4. **Visualize Data:**
    - Highlight your data and insert a bar chart to visualize sales by date.
        - Select both date and sales column (including header) → Go to insert → Charts → Bar or clustered column → You can choose any design (chart design).
        - Click on the graph → delete button to delete the graph.
5. **Experiment with Pivot Tables:**
    - Select your data and insert a pivot table.
    - Set `Region` as the row label and sum of `Sales` as the values, to see total sales by region.
        - Select full data → Insert → Pivot table → Select table range (already selected) → Choose existing worksheet → Put some rows and column (eg: A26:D30), which doesn’t overlap with any existing data → Ok
        - Right side → Click on Sales and Region → Drag and drop region into rows and sales into values → You’ve a pivot table.
        - Click on it → cmd + A → delete button to delete it.

This exercise will give you tangible experience with the fundamental tools of Excel for managing and analyzing data.
